PLEASE WAIT YOUR TURN
THERE GOES MY PERFECT ATTENDANCE
THE EXCEPTION TO THE RULE
CLEAN QUIET & PICTURESQUE
IN VOGUE
ON MY BEST BEHAVIOR
THE CREAM OF THE CROP
WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY
I LOVE YOU MOM!
MY PRIDE AND JOY
JUMP ON THE BANDWAGON
IT TAKES KNOW-HOW
I PROMISE YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED
FAR FROM ALL THE HUSTLE AND BUSTLE
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS
BARELY SCRATCHING THE SURFACE
CASH OR CREDIT?
POETIC JUSTICE
THERE'S NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY
WE'VE GOT YOU COVERED
THAT WORKS
HIP HIP HOORAY
YOU'LL NEED A PASSPORT FOR THIS ONE
BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD
THE KEYS TO THE KINGDOM
IN HOG HEAVEN
PUT YOUR BEST FOOT FORWARD
GO OUTSIDE AND PLAY
PICK UP THE PHONE
WE'RE NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET
DON'T TIP THE CANOE
BEYOND THE HORIZON
BEEF IT UP
I COULD SERIOUSLY GET USED TO THIS
NOTHING WOULD MAKE ME HAPPIER
POINT THE WAY
STRIKE IT RICH
I'M SCARED STIFF
SOMEONE'S KNOCKING AT THE DOOR
A PIECE OF THE PIE
WELCOME TO PARADISE
BACK TO SQUARE ONE
BRIGHT-EYED AND BUSHY-TAILED
THAT ONE TAKES THE CAKE
LIKE WALKING ON AIR
LET'S MAKE SOME NOISE
THERE'S NOTHING UP MY SLEEVE
ALL DRESSED UP AND EVERYWHERE TO GO
DON'T BE SHY
GO FOR A JOG
LIGHTNING IN A BOTTLE
FRIENDLY HELPFUL AND COURTEOUS
LET IT RIDE!
IMAGINE THE POSSIBILITIES
THE WHOLE BALL OF WAX
LIFE IS FULL OF SURPRISES
CHECK YOUR DEPARTURE TIME

AGE BEFORE BEAUTY
PLENTY TO GO AROUND
THERE'S SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE
ABOVE THE CLOUDS
IT ALL COMES DOWN TO THIS
PLEASED AS PUNCH
PUT ON YOUR SWIMSUIT AND HIT THE BEACH

A WORK OF GENIUS
HOW SWEET IT IS
YOU CAN'T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER
UNEXPECTED TURN OF EVENTS
CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF
FROM START TO FINISH
BY THE QUART
TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE
NICE VARIETY
THE ROAD TO RICHES
MEANWHILE BACK AT THE RANCH
FILL IN THE GAPS
FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART
ON YOUR MARK GET SET GO!
LIVE AND LEARN
ONE FOR THE RECORD BOOKS
SUNNY WITH NO CHANCE OF SHOWERS
I WAS HOPING YOU WOULD SAY THAT
A LITTLE BIRD TOLD ME
RIGHT ON TARGET
THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS
THIS SHOULD BRIGHTEN UP YOUR DAY
A PICTURE IS WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS
I BEAT YOU TO THE DRAW
THAT'S MY BREAD AND BUTTER
DON'T FORGET TO BRING YOUR APPETITE

THIS WILL BE AN ABSOLUTE BLAST
WHEN THE SMOKE CLEARS
I MAY ONLY PACK A BATHING SUIT
AND THE CROWD GOES WILD
HIGH IMPACT
THE BEST IN COMFORT AND SERVICE
GIFT IDEAS FOR HIM
DREAMS ARE FOREVER
A WAY WITH WORDS
BOGGED DOWN
COMPLETELY RELAXED
TAKE THE PLUNGE
NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT
TAKE ME TO YOUR LEADER
WORTH WAITING FOR
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?
WHAT A CAST OF CHARACTERS

THESE ARE A FEW OF MY FAVORITE THINGS
HEY BIG SPENDER SPEND A LITTLE TIME WITH ME
THEY CALL ME THE WANDERER
BABY WE WERE BORN TO RUN
IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT
UP WHERE WE BELONG
THE WEATHER OUTSIDE IS FRIGHTFUL
BETTER NOT POUT I'M TELLING YOU WHY
JINGLE BELLS JINGLE BELLS
A BUTTON NOSE AND TWO EYES MADE OUT OF COAL
RUN RUN RUDOLPH
MISSISSIPPI QUEEN IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
I FEEL GOOD I KNEW THAT I WOULD
ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK
I'M EASY LIKE SUNDAY MORNING
JUST MY IMAGINATION
STUCK IN THE MIDDLE WITH YOU
IT'S A NEW DAWN IT'S A NEW DAY
DO YOU KNOW THE WAY TO SAN JOSE?
THE LAND OF THE FREE
PRETTY WOMAN WALKING DOWN THE STREET
I'LL STOP THE WORLD AND MELT WITH YOU
GET INTO THE GROOVE
I BELIEVE IN MIRACLES
ONE NIGHT IN BANGKOK
DON'T STAND SO CLOSE TO ME
A WHOLE NEW WORLD THAT'S WHERE WE'LL BE
LET IT GO LET IT GO
WE GOT NO TROUBLES LIFE IS THE BUBBLES
CAN YOU PAINT WITH ALL THE COLORS OF THE WIND?
THIS LAND IS YOUR LAND THIS LAND IS MY LAND
NO PARTICULAR PLACE TO GO
DON'T YOU WANT SOMEBODY TO LOVE?
HERE COMES THE BRIDE
GROUND CONTROL TO MAJOR TOM
ALWAYS SOMETHING THERE TO REMIND ME
TALE AS OLD AS TIME SONG AS OLD AS RHYME
IT'S THE CIRCLE OF LIFE AND IT MOVES US ALL
I'M HOOKED ON A FEELING
BACK IN THE SADDLE AGAIN
THEN I SAW HER FACE NOW I'M A BELIEVER
THOSE LAZY HAZY CRAZY DAYS OF SUMMER
I'VE GOT TWO TICKETS TO PARADISE
I LOVE THE NIGHTLIFE
TEACH YOUR CHILDREN WELL
HEAVEN IS A PLACE ON EARTH
SUMMERTIME SUMMERTIME SUM SUM SUMMERTIME
ALL MY BAGS ARE PACKED I'M READY TO GO
YOU WEAR IT WELL
VERY SUPERSTITIOUS
ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST
LOVE IS ALL YOU NEED
HE'S MAKING A LIST AND CHECKING IT TWICE
WONDER OF WONDERS MIRACLE OF MIRACLES
FIRST TO FIGHT FOR RIGHT AND FREEDOM
I LOVE YOU JUST THE WAY YOU ARE
A SPOONFUL OF SUGAR
I'M LIKE A SHOOTING STAR I'VE COME SO FAR
DO YOU COME FROM A LAND DOWN UNDER?
ROCKY MOUNTAIN HIGH
A HOLLY JOLLY CHRISTMAS
I'M IN LOVE I'M ALL SHOOK UP
LIKE A BOLT OUT OF THE BLUE
I NEVER KNEW LOVE LIKE THIS BEFORE
SUNSHINE ON MY SHOULDERS
YOU LOOK WONDERFUL TONIGHT
SHE LOVES YOU YEAH YEAH YEAH
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT LOVE IS
WE WILL WE WILL ROCK YOU
ONCE TWICE THREE TIMES A LADY
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY
YOU GIVE ME FEVER WHEN YOU KISS ME
I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU
UNDER THE BOARDWALK DOWN BY THE SEA
THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS ARE FOR
HERE'S MY NUMBER SO CALL ME MAYBE
SCHOOL'S OUT FOR SUMMER
FEELING HOT HOT HOT
I WISH THEY ALL COULD BE CALIFORNIA GIRLS
MAMA I'M COMING HOME
SURF CITY HERE WE COME
O BEAUTIFUL FOR SPACIOUS SKIES
WALK LIKE A MAN TALK LIKE A MAN
